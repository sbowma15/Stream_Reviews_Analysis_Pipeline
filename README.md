Steam Reviews Analysis

This Python program is designed to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Steam reviews and implement a basic machine learning model. The analysis is divided into three phases:

Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
In this phase, the program explores the Steam reviews dataset and provides insightful visualizations and statistics:

Word frequency analysis
Most common words
Sentence frequency analysis
Most common n-grams
Label/target summary statistics
Libraries used: pandas, numpy, seaborn, spacy, nltk, and more.

Phase 2: Basic Model
The program implements a one-hot encoded Perceptron baseline model to predict recommendations based on the reviews. This phase involves:

Converting labels to numeric values
Preprocessing text data
Creating a baseline model using RandomForestClassifier
Evaluating the model's performance on training and validation data
Visualizing actual vs. predicted values
Libraries used: scikit-learn, spacy, matplotlib, seaborn.

Phase 3: Deep Learning Model
The README mentions a hint at a deep learning model in Phase 3, but the details of this phase are not provided in the code.
